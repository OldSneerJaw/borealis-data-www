Use the [add-on dashboard](https://pg-dashboard.borealis-data.com/) to manage a [Borealis Isolated Postgres](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/borealis-pg) add-on. To access the add-on dashboard, first open the [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps), choose an application that has the add-on attached, and then select **Borealis Isolated Postgres** from the Installed Add-ons section. For advanced functionality, like establishing an ad hoc secure tunnel to the database or installing/removing PostgreSQL extensions, use the [add-on's plugin](./pg-addon-cli) plugin for the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).
