## Personal information we collect and store

* Cookies: We may store cookies on your device(s) for authentication purposes only when you make use of [Heroku Add-on Single Sign-on](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/add-on-single-sign-on) for our Heroku Add-on(s).
* Email addresses: The email address associated with your Heroku user account may be used for the purposes of notifying you of important operational events related to your use of our Heroku Add-on(s) (for example, warning of upcoming service maintenance, storage usage alerts, failures of automated processes, etc.) and to solicit occasional feedback on your experience with our Heroku Add-on(s) (we promise to do so sparingly). Generally, whenever we need to contact you, we request your email address just in time from Heroku's API, send the email and then remove the email address from volatile memory shortly afterward without storing it in a nonvolatile storage medium (for example, a hard disk drive, solid state drive, etc.). However, when you first provision our Heroku Add-on(s), we do temporarily store your email address for up to 48 hours, after which it will be purged from any storage medium it was stored in.

## Third party services we use

We use a handful of third party services that may collect and store personal information about you.

Heroku Add-on(s):
* [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/): Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides the computing infrastructure for our Heroku Add-on(s). Information about your usage of our Heroku Add-on(s)'s computing resources may be collected and stored by AWS according to [AWS's privacy policy](https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/). Furthermore, since operational emails generated by our Heroku Add-on(s) are sent via [Amazon Simple Email Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/), the email address associated with your Heroku account is shared with AWS whenever such an email is sent. We use automated processes to perform administration tasks from time to time on computing resources (for example, database servers) that are hosted on AWS and used by our Heroku Add-on(s). We use strict access controls and industry best practices for security such that any data that is generated by your Heroku application(s) and stored on AWS's infrastructure by our Heroku Add-on(s) cannot be accessed by us without your express permission or where required by law.
* [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/): Fastmail is our corporate email service provider. Any correspondence (and associated metadata) you send to an @borealis-data.com email address may be stored by Fastmail indefinitely. See [Fastmail's privacy policy](https://www.fastmail.com/about/privacy/) for more information.
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/): When you register for a Heroku account and as you use their services, Heroku may collect and store your personal information according to [Salesforce's privacy policy](https://www.salesforce.com/company/privacy/).

Website (borealis-data.com and its subdomains):
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/): This website is hosted on GitHub Pages, which may collect and store your personal information according to [GitHub's privacy policy](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement).

We may disclose your personal information only if we are required to do so by law or if you are in violation of the [Terms of Use](https://www.borealis-data.com/heroku-elements-supplemental-terms-of-use) of our Heroku Add-on(s). We do not sell or otherwise share your personal information with anyone else for any reason other than those reasons already stated in this policy.

## Personal information of minors

Our services are not targeted to minors. We do not knowingly collect or store personal information from anyone under the age of 13.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time and without prior notice. All changes take effect immediately when they are published on this website.
