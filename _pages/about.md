We believe that every app deserves the highest grade security, whether it's a personal blog, an online store or a government financial aid portal. Best practices are clear that an app's backend services should always expose the smallest footprint possible to prevent breaches of sensitive data; in other words, only the app itself should be able to talk to your database and other services directly. Never gamble with users' data. That's why our Heroku add-ons lock each data integration away in its own virtual private cloud while providing simple tools to seamlessly open a secure tunnel to the data service.
